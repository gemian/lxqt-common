Icon/Logo by Andy Fitzsimon (c) 2011.


Conversation backlog (Andy vs. petr):


how does a pizza cutter sound for the logo/icon ?

my rationale

pizza cutters are lxqts.
on the right angle they spell QT

also, everyone likes pizza

pizzas are already light but a pizza cutter makes pizza chunks edible whereas eating a whole uncut pizza would be awesome but stupid

I'm pretty happy with how dynamic it is as a mark / metaphor.

"LxQt-QT is a desktop environment that severs all bloated libraries and junk to give you more speed, space and control.

LxQt-QT is a bite sized modern desktop and it tastes great!"
